# Crystal_CaseStudy

Participants:

- Adrián Landaverde Nava
- Cristian Gonzága Lopez
- Andrés Morones
- Joel Erick Martínez Espinosa

We analyzed the energy dataset which is calles 'energy__data-2.csv'

Fisrtly we made our Exploratory Data Analysis using R. To do so, we created a Shiny Dashaboard App to visualize and manipulate the plots and graphs. This was made using the file 'app.R'. And the final dashboard is shown in this page: https://adrian-landaverde.shinyapps.io/CrystalCaseStudy/ 

After this EDA in R, we deployed several models using Machine Learning algorithms and Time Series Analysis in Python. This part of the study is found on the 'Energy_Final.ipynb' file.
